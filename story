Once upon a time in the forest there lived a monkey on a berry tree which was on the banks of a river.
In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife.

One day the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some berries.
The crocodile loved them and came back the next day again.
The monkey and the crocodile soon became good friends.

One day the monkey send some fruits for the crocodile's wife.
She the liked the juicy fruits but she was jealous that the crocodile was spending so much time with the monkey.
So she told her husband,"if the fruits are so juicy just imagine how sweet the monkey,s heart would be.
Get me the monkeys heart." 
The crocodile did not want to kill his friend but he has no choice.
